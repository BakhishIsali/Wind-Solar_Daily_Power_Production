# Wind_Solar_Daily_Power_Production

This dataset consists of wind and solar energy production records on an hourly basis for the French grid since 2020. Its primary purpose is to enable the Commission de Régulation de l'Énergie (CRE) to calculate the reference price used in the calculation of additional remuneration for the wind and solar sectors.

The additional remuneration is a support mechanism for wind and solar energy producers, as defined in Articles L. 314-18 to L. 314-27 of the Energy Code. This mechanism was introduced by the Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth (LTECV). It allows renewable energy producers who directly market their electricity to receive a premium that compensates for the difference between their income from sales and a reference remuneration level. The reference remuneration is fixed by public authorities through a tariff decree or by the producer through a competition procedure, depending on the type of installation.
